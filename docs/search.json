Though yet to be formally confirmed as a pandemic, suspicions have intensified following a recent shocking surge in patients presenting with symptoms indicative of Legionellosis.\nLegionellosis is caused by Legionella pneumophila. It is typically transmitted through the inhalation of contaminated water droplets, such as those from air conditioning systems or hot tubs. Symptoms include fever, chills, cough, muscle aches, and headaches. Residents of Inverkeld experiencing any of these symptoms are advised to contact their GP or dial 111 for health advice.\nIn a press release, the director of the Queen Rose in Inverkeld noted a unsettling uptick in individuals reporting symptoms consistent with those associated with Legionellosis. Worries were first raised when the local GPs began reporting an unusual increase in patients with symptoms of Legionellosis. While investigations are still ongoing, the possibility of a pandemic outbreak hovers, prompting concern from health agencies.\nIn response to the developing concerns, health officials have initiated several contingency plans, and Inverkeld have convened an Emergency Pandemic Response Team, which will be meeting on 2025-01-31 and attempting to find solutions that will stop the spread of the pandemic in Inverkeld.\nThe First Minister assured residents that authorities are leaving leaving no option unexplored in their efforts to safeguard public health, and furthermore urged residents to remain vigilant and cooperate with health directives from the Inverkeld City Council. A statement released by the First Minister’s office read: “While there is no confirmation of an outbreak at this time, we are taking this situation very seriously.”\nThe people in Inverkeld have already begun to weigh the possibility of a pandemic; potential consequences such as school closures, economic repercussions, and strain on healthcare resources, have sparked apprehension among residents, underscoring the need for swift and decisive action.\nContact Information for Further Updates:\n\nMore information will be posted on the Inverkeld website as the situation develops: https://www.InverkeldCouncil.co.uk\nThe Inverkeld Emergency Pandemic Response Team can be contacted on +44 01786 7676 3961 or at pandemic_response@Inverkeld.co.uk\n\nAbout the Author:\nCarolina Romero is a health correspondent at the Inverkeld Herald, specializing in public health and safety issues.She can be contacted at cr5299@InverkeldHerald.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inverkeld city centre\n\n\nInverkeld was granted city status in 1939.

[explain why]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with R, or if this is your first time working with R, you may find some of the following resources helpful:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WebR instance we will be using has the tidyverse package already installed for you, so you do not need to load it using the library(tidyverse) command. The tidyverse package contains ggplot2, dplyr, readr, and a number of other packages that make working with data in R easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that all of these data are available remotely through a cloud server and you can work with them using the webR instance in this browser window - you do not need to install R or download the files to your own computer.\nHowever, you do need to make sure you are working with the correct data. Please make sure you carefully check the filename(s) for your particular pandemic scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou may divide the data analysis tasks amongst your group members, and work through the sections/tasks, in any order you choose.\nAs you work through each task, note that there are tips and hints that you can expand for additional help.\n\n\n\n\nCity Demographics, Polling, and Budget\n\nYou will want to understand the demographics of Inverkeld to inform your pandemic responses: for example, you will want to know the number of people living in your city, the number people in demographic groups that might be particularly vulnerable during this pandemic, and so on.
