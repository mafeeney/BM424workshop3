Though yet to be formally confirmed as a pandemic, suspicions have intensified following a recent worrying surge in patients presenting with symptoms indicative of Legionellosis.\nLegionellosis is caused by Legionella pneumophila. It is typically transmitted through the inhalation of contaminated water droplets, such as those from air conditioning systems or hot tubs. Symptoms include fever, chills, cough, muscle aches, and headaches. Residents of Inverkeld experiencing any of these symptoms are advised to contact their GP or dial 111 for health advice.\nIn a press release, the director of the Queen Rose in Inverkeld noted a shocking uptick in individuals reporting symptoms consistent with those associated with Legionellosis. Fears were first raised when the local GPs began reporting an unusual increase in patients with symptoms of Legionellosis. While investigations are still ongoing, the possibility of a pandemic outbreak shadows the community, prompting concern from health agencies.\nIn response to the expanding concerns, health officials have launched several preventive actions, and Inverkeld have convened an Emergency Pandemic Response Team, which will be meeting on 2025-01-31 and attempting to find solutions that will stop the spread of the pandemic in Inverkeld.\nThe First Minister assured residents that authorities are leaving pursuing every lead in their efforts to safeguard public health, and furthermore urged residents to remain vigilant and cooperate with health directives from the Inverkeld City Council. A statement released by the First Minister’s office read: “While we cannot confirm the presence of an outbreak right now, we are responding to this issue with the highest degree of seriousness.”\nThe people in Inverkeld have already begun to dread the possibility of a pandemic; potential consequences such as school closures, economic repercussions, and strain on healthcare resources, have sparked apprehension among residents, underscoring the need for swift and decisive action.\nContact Information for Further Updates:\n\nMore information will be posted on the Inverkeld website as the situation develops: https://www.InverkeldCouncil.co.uk\nThe Inverkeld Emergency Pandemic Response Team can be contacted on +44 01343 8129 5753 or at pandemic_response@Inverkeld.co.uk\n\nAbout the Author:\nSequest Solowiej is a health correspondent at the Inverkeld News, specializing in public health and safety issues.She can be contacted at ss2718@InverkeldNews.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inverkeld city centre\n\n\nInverkeld was granted city status in 1948. Located near Ailsa Falls, Inverkeld is noted for one of the most famous art festivals in Europe. Major industries in the city include banking, manufacturing, and agriculture.\nInverkeld is well-served by public transport: there are 3 bus companies operating routes that cover the city and outlying areas, and road links to other major cities (the A47 to Inverness and the the A72 to Motherwell.) Inverkeld is further connected to regional towns and villages by rail services from the Inverkeld railway station. Inverkeld is also served by Inverkeld Airport, which is 7 miles from the city centre and which offers daily flights to Warsaw, Helsinki, and Seville.\nNotable buildings in the city include Inverkeld Castle, Inverkeld Cathedral, and Inverloch Theatre. Inverkeld also has a number of historic landmarks and several historic monuments. The Inverkeld whisky festival is held annually in May, and tourists also flock to Inverkeld to take wildlife watching tours in summer. Inverkeld is also noted as a hub of local arts and culture, with Paramount Theatre and Riverfront Theatre drawing in crowds for performances from local and international artists. The city is renowned for sports, with the Lions and Falcons teams representing the city for football and rugby league, respectively.\nSome of the key Inverkeld features are summarized in the list below.\n\nPublic Facilities/Community Amenities\n\nSchools:\n\n5 primary schools\n4 secondary schools\n1 college\n\nNurseries: 13\nCare Homes: 6\nRestaurants and Cafes: 114\nParks and Playgrounds: 13\nLibraries: 4\nGyms and Sports Facilities: 11\nPrisons: 3\nPolice and Fire Stations: 5\nSurgeries and pharmacies: 6\nHospital: the Queen Rose\n\nRefer to the “Data” tab for information about the city demographics, voting and polling data, and more information about the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse-coloured scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a group of Legionella pneumophila cells.

The general syntax for the head() function with a specified number of rows is: head(data_frame, n) where data_frame is your data frame (in this case, you might name your data frame something like “budget”) and n is the number of rows you want to view. For example, if you want to view the first 10 rows of your data instead of the default 6, you can use the following command: head(budget, 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nUse the WebR cell below to load and examine your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI need a hint!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse read_csv() to load your data.\nUse head() or glimpse() to examine your data.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp!
