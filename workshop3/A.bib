  abstract  = "ABSTRACT Public health agencies are increasingly relying on
               genomics during Legionnaires' disease investigations. However,
               the causative bacterium ( Legionella pneumophila ) has an
               unusual population structure, with extreme temporal and spatial
               genome sequence conservation. Furthermore, Legionnaires' disease
               outbreaks can be caused by multiple L. pneumophila genotypes in
               a single source. These factors can confound cluster
               identification using standard phylogenomic methods. Here, we
               show that a statistical learning approach based on L.
               pneumophila core genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
               comparisons eliminates ambiguity for defining outbreak clusters
               and accurately predicts exposure sources for clinical cases. We
               illustrate the performance of our method by genome comparisons
               of 234 L. pneumophila isolates obtained from patients and
               cooling towers in Melbourne, Australia, between 1994 and 2014.
               This collection included one of the largest reported
               Legionnaires' disease outbreaks, which involved 125 cases at an
               aquarium. Using only sequence data from L. pneumophila cooling
               tower isolates and including all core genome variation, we built
               a multivariate model using discriminant analysis of principal
               components (DAPC) to find cooling tower-specific genomic
               signatures and then used it to predict the origin of clinical
               isolates. Model assignments were 93\% congruent with
               epidemiological data, including the aquarium Legionnaires'
               disease outbreak and three other unrelated outbreak
               investigations. We applied the same approach to a recently
               described investigation of Legionnaires' disease within a UK
               hospital and observed a model predictive ability of 86\%. We
               have developed a promising means to breach L. pneumophila
               genetic diversity extremes and provide objective source
               attribution data for outbreak investigations. IMPORTANCE
               Microbial outbreak investigations are moving to a paradigm where
               whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic trees are used to
               support epidemiological investigations. It is critical that
               outbreak source predictions are accurate, particularly for
               pathogens, like Legionella pneumophila , which can spread widely
               and rapidly via cooling system aerosols, causing Legionnaires'
               disease. Here, by studying hundreds of Legionella pneumophila
               genomes collected over 21 years around a major Australian city,
               we uncovered limitations with the phylogenetic approach that
               could lead to a misidentification of outbreak sources. We
               implement instead a statistical learning technique that
               eliminates the ambiguity of inferring disease transmission from
               phylogenies. Our approach takes geolocation information and core
               genome variation from environmental L. pneumophila isolates to
               build statistical models that predict with high confidence the
               environmental source of clinical L. pneumophila during disease
               outbreaks. We show the versatility of the technique by applying
               it to unrelated Legionnaires' disease outbreaks in Australia and
               the UK.",
