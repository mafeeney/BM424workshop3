  abstract  = "Pandemics, increases in disease incidence that affect multiple
               regions of the world, present huge challenges to health care
               systems and in particular to policymakers, public health
               authorities, clinicians, and all health care workers (HCWs). The
               recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of severely
               ill patients, many of whom who have required hospital and
               intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The discipline of critical
               care is a vital and integral component of pandemic preparedness.
               Safe and effective critical care has the potential to improve
               outcomes, motivate individuals to seek timely medical attention,
               and attenuate the devastating sequelae of a severe pandemic. To
               achieve this, suitable critical care planning and preparation
               are essential.",

               experience of four projects funded under the Horizon2020
               programme, namely ReCoDID, ORCHESTRA, unCoVer and SYNCHROS. The

               patient level data from observational cohorts. We focus on
               compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
               and ethics approvals when sharing data across national borders.
               We discuss procedures for data mapping; submission of new
               international codes to standards organisation; federated
               approach; and centralised data curation. Finally, we put forward
               recommendations for the development of guidelines for the
               application of GDPR in case of major public health threats;
               mandatory standards for data collection in funding frameworks;
               training and capacity building for data owners; cataloguing of
